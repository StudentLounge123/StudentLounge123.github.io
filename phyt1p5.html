      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">1.3 Motion: Forces, Weight, Velocity and Free Fall.</h1>
      <p>Force is a push or pull. It is measured in Newton using force meter. It is
        applied on the object and can affect in many ways. For example, it could:</p>
    
        <p>‚Ä¢ Make a stationery object move</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Make a moving object stop, speed up, slow down, change direction
            (accelerate) </p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ Change shape of the object (e.g. stretch, compress, break)</p>
        

      <ol>‚ùñ Force is a vector. It has a magnitude and direction</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ When a single force is applied to an object of certain mass, it causes
        an acceleration in the same direction of the force.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ The equation relating the force applied, the mass of the object and
        the acceleration is f=ma.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ Forces can act in different directions since it is a vector and multiple
        forces can act on the same object.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ Forces may include friction, weight, magnetic force, air resistance,
        tension, thrust, water resistance.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ Water resistance, air resistance and friction are all called drag forces
        and they act to the opposite direction of motion. For example, if a
        boat in the sea is moving towards the left, the water resistance
        would act upon the boat in the opposite direction which is towards
        the right. Another example would be a stone falling freely
        downwards. The stone is moving downwards, so the air resistance
        acting upon the stone would act upwards since it is the opposite
        direction of motion.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ Weight is also called gravitational force and it is defined as the force
        attracting objects to the centre of the earth or pulling them
        downwards</ol>
      <ol>‚ùñ Since multiple forces can act on the same object, we should be
        familiar with something called the resultant force. The resultant
        force is the single force which will have the same effect as the
        multiple forces acting on the object. For example, if a force of 5N is
        applied to a box pushing it in the left direction and another force of
        9N is applied to the same box pushing it in the right direction. The
        resultant force would be the net force of these two forces. So, the
        resultant force would be 4N to the right. (9 to right ‚Äì 5 to left = 4 to
        right).
        </ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ If a single force acts on a stationery object in a certain direction, it
        would result in the motion of the object with an acceleration in the
        same direction as the force.</ol>

      <ol> ‚ùñ If a single force acts on a moving object in the same direction of
        motion, the object will accelerate in that same direction of motion
        and force.</ol>
      <ol>‚ùñ If a single force acts on a moving object in a different direction from
        the direction of motion, the object will decelerate.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ As a GCSE or IGCSE student, you should be able to know the
        magnitude and the direction of the resultant force when there are
        two forces acting in different planes when, for example, a force of 3N
        acts on a point towards the north and a force of 4N acts on the same
        point towards the east. Since they are acting in different planes, you
        cannot simply subtract or add them together. Instead, you should
        draw a parallelogram of forces to determine the magnitude and
        direction of the resultant force. (diagrams shown below for a better
        understanding) </ol>
        <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/x87YGtd/Screenshot-2020-12-28-042432.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-042432" border="0"></a>

      <ol>‚ùñ As discussed earlier, weight is a gravitational force so it would have
        the same equation of f=ma. So, weight of an object on earth is =
        mass of the object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity on
        earth which is 9.8 m/ùíî^
        ùüê
        rounded to ùüèùüéùíé/ùíî^
        ùüê
        So, the weight of an
        object on earth = its mass * 10</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ A free fall is the movement of the object under the force of gravity
        or weight. A free-falling object is not affected by any other forces
        such as air resistance or water resistance. The only force affecting a
        free-falling object is its weight. A free-falling object would move by
        an acceleration of 9.8 ùíé/ùíî^
        ùüê which is equal to the acceleration due
        to gravity.
        </ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ In practical life though, there is always air resistance affecting the
        object that is falling. But in theoretical physics question, we
        sometimes then ignore the air resistance to the object because it
        may be very minimal.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ However, you should be able to know the motion of objects falling
        under the effect of both gravity and air resistance. You should be able
        to interpret the graphs of their motion and explain it. </ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ Once an object falls, the only force affecting it is gravity. This would
        cause the object to accelerate by 9.8 ùíé/ùíî^
        ùüê
        . However, as the speed
        of the object increases, air resistance also increases. The air
        resistance keeps increasing and the acceleration of the object will
        decrease. This means that the object speed will still increase but by a
        less amount in the same time period. The air resistance would keep
        increasing until it becomes equal to the weight. At this point of
        motion, there is no resultant force. This in turn means that the
        acceleration becomes 0. the object now is moving at its maximum
        constant velocity called the terminal velocity. The speed-time graph
        for this motion, explained above, is shown below. </ol>
        <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/x13XSvh/Screenshot-2020-12-28-042812.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-042812" border="0"></a>
      <ol>‚ùñ Another example should be aware of as an IGCSE or GCSE physics
        student, is a skydiver falling then opening a parachute. It would have
        the same speed time graph shown above, however, there would be a
        slight addition to it. The motion of a skydiver is explained in the next
        bullet point.</ol>

      <ol>‚ùñ Once the skydiver falls, the only force affecting him is gravity. He
        would accelerate with 9.8 ùíé/ùíî^
        ùüê And as the speed is increasing, the
        air resistance would also increase up to the point where the air
        resistance becomes equal to the gravity. At this point, the skydiver
        reaches the terminal velocity. Then, the skydiver would open his
        parachute. The parachute increases the area in contact with the air.
        This makes the air resistance increase even more and become
        greater than the weight. The resultant force now acts upwards. And
        the motion of the skydiver is downwards. this means that the
        skydiver will decelerate because the direction of the motion Is
        opposite to the direction of the resultant force. As the speed of the
        skydiver decreases, the air resistance decreases as well until it
        becomes equal to the weight. Now, there is no resultant force, and
        once again the skydiver will reach a lower terminal velocity until he
        lands. The speed-time graph is shown below. </ol>
        <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tqNwSx5/Screenshot-2020-12-28-043327.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-043327" border="0"></a>

      <ol> ‚ùñ Remember that air resistance increases when the speed of the object
        increases and vice versa. It also increases when the area in contact
        with the air increase and vice versa. When some objects are thrown
        at the same time, some reach the ground before the others due to
        the air resistance. But if they are thrown at the same time in a place
        where there is no air resistance ‚Äì free-falling(such as the moon) , the
        objects would reach the ground at the same time because the only
        force acting on all of them is gravity (weight) and the acceleration
        due to gravity is the same in all objects. It is always constant and it is
        always 9.8 ùíé/ùíî^2
        </ol>
      <ol>‚ùñ An object moving in a circular motion will have a resultant force
        acting upon the object keeping it in the circular track. This force is
        called the centripetal force. It acts towards the centre of the circle
        and perpendicular to direction of motion keeping the object in a
        curved path. Remember that an object moving in a circle will always
        have non-uniform (non-constant) velocity even if it is moving with a
        constant speed. That is because the direction is changed and velocity
        is defined by directions since it is a vector</ol>
      <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/C2R0Csb/Screenshot-2020-12-28-043540.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-043540" border="0"></a>
      <ol>‚ùñ When talking about motion, there are three laws that you should learn
        and apply. These are Newtons three laws of motion which are:</ol>
      <ol> ‚Ä¢ First law: an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a
        constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.
        </ol>
      <ol> Second law: ùíá = ùíéa</ol>
      <ol> ‚Ä¢ Third law: When one body exerts a force on a second body, the
        second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and
        opposite in direction on the first body</ol>
      <ol> ‚ùñ Another important law that should be taken into account is Hooke‚Äôs law
        which applies to elastic materials only such as springs (elastic materials
        are materials that stretch proportionally when force is applied to them
        and gain their shape after the force is removed).
        </ol>
      <ol>‚ùñ Hooke‚Äôs law states that springs will extend directly proportionally to the
        force applied to them until they reach their elastic limit (or limit of
        proportionality). It has the equation below:
        ùíá = ùíåùíô
        Where f is the force applied, x is the springs extension and k is the
        springs constant. </ol>
