      <p>Introduction</p>
    
        <p>In physics, we have physical quantities that we either measure or calculate. You may think at first and wonder what the difference between measuring and
        calculating a quantity is. You would think that they are the same.</p>
        <p>However, in physics, measuring a quantity is a primary stage while calculating a quantity is
        a secondary process. So, we would first measure certain quantities using
        devices and then we would plug these measured values into a formula to
        calculate a secondary quantity. Let us take an example to clarify this difference even more.</p>

        <p>To get the density of a certain material, you would have to have its mass and
        volume at first. So, if we are going to get the density of mercury, we would
        have to measure its mass using a device which would be, in that case, a
        balance. we would also have to measure the volume using a graduated
        cylinder. Then, we will plug in these measured quantities (mass, and volume)
        in a formula to calculate the density. That formula would be
        density=mass/volume.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
       
        
        
       


        In physics, we have a lot of quantities and each quantity has its own units.
        Here is a list of most quantities that you should be familiar with:

      <ol>length – meter</ol>

      <ol>mass - kilogram</ol>

      <ol>time - second</ol>

      <ol>electric current - ampere</ol>

      <ol>Volume - meter cube</ol>

      <ol>acceleration - meter per second square</ol>

      <ol> force – newton</ol>
      <ol>energy-joule</ol>

      <ol>temperature-degree Celsius</ol>

      <ol> density-gram per cm cube</ol>

  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Quantities: measuring, rules and precautions
      </h1>
      <p>Volume:</p>
        <p>Volume is the amount of space an object occupies.</p>
        <p>To measure this, you must know what type of object you are dealing with.
        So, if you would like to measure the volume of a regular solid (e.g. cube), you
        would easily measure the dimensions of the cube by a ruler (length, width,
        height) and multiply them together. And to measure the volume of a liquid,
        you cannot measure its dimensions! you would instead use a graduated
        cylinder.</p> 
        <p>The following lists and explains the steps needed to measure the
        volumes of different types of objects:</p>
       <ol> • Liquids</ol>
       <ol> ▪ Equipment needed: graduated cylinder or a beaker</ol>
      <p>  <ol>▪ Steps and Precautions:</ol></p>
       <p><ol> ✓ pour the liquid carefully into the graduated cylinder (if it
        is not too much) or into the beaker (if it is a larger
        volume)</ol>
        <ol>✓ look perpendicular to the scale and take the reading to
        get an accurate reading.</ol>
        <ol> ✓ Avoid the meniscus to get an accurate reading.</ol>
        <ol> ✓ Look from where the scale is calibrated to get an accurate
        reading.</ol></p>
       <p> • Regular solids: </p>
       <p> ▪ Equipment needed: ruler</p>
       <p> ▪ Steps and precautions:</p>
        <ol>✓ Measure the dimensions of the objects</ol>
       <ol> ✓ Look perpendicular to the scale of the ruler to get an
        accurate reading.</ol>
       <ol> ✓ Check for the zero error. If your ruler starts from the
        3cm mark because its broken and the object ends at the
        10 cm mark, then the length of the object is 7 cm not 10
        cm.</ol>
       <ol> ✓ Make sure the scale of the ruler is appropriate to object.
        You cannot measure the length of a pencil using a meter
        rule!</ol>
       <ol> ✓ Take your dimensions and put them in a formula to
        calculate the volume</ol>
        <p>• Irregular solids that sink:</p>
        <p> ▪ Equipment needed: measuring cylinder or beaker</p>
        <p> ▪ Steps and precautions:</p>
       <ol> ✓ Put a set amount of water in the measuring cylinder and
        take the reading of the volume using the precautions
        discussed above. That reading would be v1.</ol>
        <ol>  ✓ Put the object in the cylinder with the water. Put it carefully
        and avoid splashing of water and let it sink.</ol>
        <ol>  ✓ Using the precautions above, take the reading again of the
        water and the object. This reading would be v2.</ol>
        <ol>  ✓ Subtract v1(volume of water) from v2(volume of water
        and object) to get the volume of the object only.</ol>
        <p> • Irregular solids that float:</p>
        <p> ▪ Equipment needed: measuring cylinder or beaker, sinker (photo of
        the sinker is attached below to help you understand)</p>
        <p>▪ Steps and precautions:</p>
        <ol> ✓ Put a set amount of water and the sinker in the measuring
        cylinder and take the reading of the volume using the
        precautions discussed above. That reading would be v1.</ol>
        <ol> ✓ Remove the sinker and attach the object to it.</ol>
        <ol> ✓ Put back the sinker with the object attached in the water in
        the cylinder.</ol>
        <ol>✓ Take the reading again of the volume of the water, the
        sinker, and the object. That would be v2.</ol>
        <ol>✓ Subtract v1(volume of water and sinker) from v2(volume of
        water, sinker and object) to get the volume of the object
        only.</ol>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Length:</h1>
      <p>There are many ways to measure length of objects depending again on the
        object.
        • Before we start, we should know the units and the conversions.</p>
      <p>  <ol>▪ 1 km =1000 m</ol>
        <ol> ▪ 1 m =100 cm</ol>
        <ol>▪ 1 cm =10mm</ol>
        <ol> ▪ 1 mm = 1000 micrometre (um)</ol>
        <ol> ▪ 1 micrometre = 1000 nanometre (nm)</ol></p>
        <p>• Devices you can use:</p>  <p>
          <ol>  ▪ Measuring tape – can measure more than one metre</ol>
            <ol>  ▪ Meter rule – can measure up to one meter</ol>
              <ol> ▪ Cm ruler -can measure up to 40 cm and smallest division is 1 mm</ol>
                <ol> ▪ Vernier calliper – smallest division is 0.1 mm</ol>
                  <ol> ▪ Micrometre screw gauge – used for very small lengths and
        smallest division is up to 0.01 mm</ol></p>
        <p> • How to get an accurate reading as much as possible:</p>
        <ol>   ▪ Make sure the device you are using suits the object you are
        measuring</ol>
        <ol>  ▪ Look perpendicular to the scale of the ruler.</ol>
          <ol>   ▪ Smaller divisions give more accurate readings.</ol>
            <ol>  ▪ Check for the zero error [discussed above]</ol>
              <ol>  ▪ For reliability, repeat the readings several times and take average
        [this apply to any measurements]</ol><a href="https://ibb.co/TDyYtBm"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/j9tbDvg/Screenshot-2020-12-28-025332.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-025332" border="0"></a> </p>
