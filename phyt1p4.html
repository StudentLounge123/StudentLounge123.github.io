      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Graphs: distance-time and speed-time</h1>
      <p>A very common way to illustrate the journey of a moving object is graphs. in
        this curriculum, you are required to know how to plot, draw, and interpret
        distance-time graphs as well as speed-time graphs.</p>
    
        <p>• A distance-time graph would have the distance covered plotted on the
            Y-axis and the time taken plotted on the X-axis.</p>
        <p>• Speed-time graph would have the speed of the object on the Y-axis and
            the time taken plotted on the X-axis</p>

        <p>Velocity-time graphs are also important and you may be asked to interpret
            them. They are very similar to the speed time graphs. However, they have, on
            the Y-axis, negative values to indicate moving in the opposite direction.</p>
        
            <p>How to interpret them?
            </p>
        
                <p>• For distance-time graphs:</p>
        
                    <p>Calculating the slope of the line would give you the speed. Slope or gradient
                        of the graph is calculated by drawing a right-angle triangle to the line (if it is
                        straight) or to the tangent (if it is a curve). Rise÷run=gradient. (change in Y) ÷
                        (change in X) =Gradient. </p>
        
        

      <ol>✓ So, a straight line with a constant slope means that the object
        is moving at a constant uniform speed.</ol>

      <ol>✓ So, a curve which is flattening means it has a decreasing slope
        indicating that the object is slowing down or decelerating. </ol>

      <ol>✓ So, a curve which is growing exponentially has an increasing
        slope indicating that the object is speeding up or accelerating.</ol>

      <ol>✓ So, a flat horizontal line means it has a slope of zero which
        indicates the object is not moving or at rest.
        </ol>
        <p>Graphs are shown below for better understanding.</p>
        <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3Ftq0tM/Screenshot-2020-12-28-034349.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-034349" border="0"></a>
        <p>• Speed-time graphs:
        </p>
        <p>Calculating the slope on this graph would give you the acceleration of
            the object. The acceleration is a vector quantity and it is defined as the
            change in velocity per unit time (how the velocity of the car changes
            relative to time). Deceleration is negative acceleration (it means object
            is slowing down // its velocity is decreasing) </p>
            <ol>✓ So, a straight line going upwards with a constant positive slope
                means that the speed of the object is increasing with the uniform
                acceleration. This means that the object’s speed increases by the
                same amount in the same time period.</ol>

            <ol>✓ So, a straight line going downwards with a constant negative slope
                means that the object’s speed is decreasing and the deceleration
                is uniform. The speed decreases by the same amounts in the same
                time periods. </ol>
      
            <ol>✓ So, a curve that is flattening with decreasing slope indicates the
                speed of the object is increasing with decreasing acceleration. This
                means that the object’s speed increases by a less amount in the
                same time period.
                </ol>
      
            <ol>✓ So, A curve which is growing exponentially means the slope is
                increasing. This means the object’s speed increases by a greater
                amount in the same time period. This is increasing acceleration.</ol>
      
            <ol>✓ So, a flat line means there is a slope of zero indication there is no
                acceleration and the speed is constant.
                </ol>
