      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">1.2 Scalars and Vectors: Speed, Velocity,
        Distance, Displacement and Acceleration </h1>
      <p>Introduction</p>
    
        <p>In Physics, we classify physical quantities into 2 categories: scalar and vector</p>
        <p>Scalar quantities have a magnitude which is a value but they don't need to be
            defined by direction. For example, you could say that the speed of the car is 25
            metres per second but we do not need to state the direction of the car. </p>

        <p>Vector
            quantities, on the other hand, have both magnitude and direction. For
            example, the velocity of the car is 25 metres per second and you have to state
            the direction of the car. So, the speed of the car is 25 metres per second while
            the velocity of the car is 25 metres per second to the East.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
       
        
        
       


            Scalar quantities include distance, speed, time, temperature, lengths, area,
            and energy.
            Vector quantities include displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, etc

           <p> Take the following example so you can have a better understanding of this
            classification.</p> 
            <p> Temperature, a scalar quantity, has no direction. It only has a value, so the
                body’s temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. We do not need to refer to this
                temperature with a direction. This makes it a scalar.</p>
                <p>However, when I apply a force to a chair and say that the force applied to the
                    chair is 15 newtons. This doesn't make enough sense. I would have to say the
                    direction of the force applied to clarify. So, for example I would say I applied a
                    force of 15 Newton to the chair lifting it upwards.
                    </p>

  <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Displacement and Distance:
      </h1>
      <p>The difference between distance and displacement is very important. The
        distance covered by a moving object is different from the displacement done
        to this object. To clarify more and have a better understanding, look at the
        photo below.</p><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ydt7JWk/Screenshot-2020-12-28-032100.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2020-12-28-032100" border="0"></a>
        <p>Basically, distance covered by a moving object is the length that this object has
            moved regardless of the direction while displacement is the shortest distance
            between the starting point and the ending point. The displacement is always a
            straight line and it has a direction. This makes the distance a scalar quantity
            and the displacement a vector quantity. An object moving in a straight line
            would have the same displacement and the same distance.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Speed and Velocity:</h1>
      <p>• Speed is the distance covered by an object in unit time. </p>
    <p>  ▪ To calculate the speed of a moving object, should first know the
      distance that this object has travelled and the time taken by the
      object to travel such distance. To calculate the average speed, you
      should divide the total distance covered by the total time taken.
      Speed, as discussed earlier, is a scalar quantity which means it only
      has a magnitude but no direction.</p>
      <p>  • Velocity is the displacement of the object per unit time. </p>
      <p> ▪ To calculate the velocity of a moving object, you have to divide the
        displacement done by the time taken. Velocity, as discussed earlier, is
        a vector quantity which means it has both direction and magnitude. </p>
        <ol>✓ An object which is moving in a straight line would, as discussed earlier,
        have the same displacement and distance. This, in turn, means that it
        would have the same velocity and speed.</ol>
        <ol>✓ An object moving in a circle with constant speed has a uniform
            magnitude but it is changing its direction every instant. This means its
            speed is uniform but its velocity is changing since the direction is
            changing. </ol>
        <ol>✓ An object moving in a circular motion doing one full turn will have a
            displacement of zero since it has the same starting and final point.
            However, the distance covered is the circumference of the circle. </ol>
           <p> When the velocity of an object changes, it goes through acceleration which is
            defined as the change in velocity per unit time. The equation for acceleration
            is 𝒂 =
            𝒗−𝒖/
            𝒕
            where v is the final velocity and u is the initial velocity. The unit for
            acceleration is 𝒎/𝒔^2</p>
        <p>There are some equations for motion that you need to learn.
            </p>  <p>
          <ol> • 𝒗^
            𝟐– 𝒖^
            𝟐 = 𝟐𝒂𝒔
            (use this equation if you do not know the time taken// ‘s’ is the
            displacement done )
          </ol>
            <ol>    • 𝒔 = 𝒖𝒕 +
                𝒂𝒕^𝟐/
                𝟐
                (use this equation if you do not know the final velocity)
                </ol>
              <ol> • 𝒗 = 𝒂𝒕 + u</ol>
              </p>
