      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">1.9 Energy, Work and Power</h1>
      <p>➢ Energy is identified as doing work or making change. Its unit is joule(J).</p>
    
        <p>➢ There are several types of energy that can be stored. These types are:</p>
        
        

      <ol>• Gravitational potential energy. It is stored when objects are
        elevated. To calculate it, multiply the mass of the object lifted, the
        height at which it is lifted and the acceleration due to gravity. The
        equation is as follows:
        G.P.E = 𝒎𝒈h</ol>

      <ol>• Kinetic energy. Objects store this type of energy when they move.
        To calculate it, you have to multiply the mass of the object by the
        square of its velocity and then divide the product by two. The
        equation is as follows:
        K.E =
        𝒎𝒗^
        𝟐/
        2</ol>

      <ol>• Elastic potential energy (strain). This type of energy is stored
        when elastic objects are stretched or compressed. How to
        calculate elastic potential energy is not required. </ol>

      <ol>• Chemical energy. This type of energy is stored in fuel and food
        and can be transformed to other types of energy. For example,
        when a car burns fuel to move, the chemical energy is
        transformed to kinetic energy. </ol>
        <p>➢ There are other types of energy but cannot be stored like sound energy,
            light energy, etc. </p>
        <p>➢ Energy can transform from type to another.</p> 
        <p>➢ There is a law called the conservation of energy which states that
            energy cannot be destroyed nor created. It only transforms from one
            type to the other or transfers from one place to another. Read the
            following example for a better understanding.</p>
        <p>➢ Imagine having a very hot cup of tea. You left it for hours in your room
            and you came back and found it cold. The thermal energy stored
            previously in the cup of tea is not destroyed. It is just transferred to
            (lost) surroundings.
            </p>
        <p>➢ In any system or process, part of the energy would be wasted or lost to
            the surroundings. We would say the energy is dissipated.
            </p> 
        <p>➢ For every process or system, we would calculate its efficiency. The
            efficiency of the system is the useful energy output expressed as a
            percentage of the total energy input. Read the following example for a
            better understanding.</p>
        <p>➢ Imagine having a light bulb with input of 100 joules of electrical energy
            input. Out of these 100 joules, 70 joules are transformed to light energy
            and 30 joules are transformed to thermal energy. The useful output
            here is the light energy and the wasted output is the thermal energy. To
            calculate the efficiency, do as follows:
            𝑬𝒇𝒇𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒚 =
            𝒖𝒔𝒆𝒇𝒖𝒍 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒑𝒖𝒕/
            𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒊𝒏𝒑𝒖𝒕 =
            𝟕𝟎/
            𝟏𝟎𝟎 = 𝟕𝟎%
            </p>
        <p>➢ Imagine having a ball that was initially stationery with kinetic energy of
            zero and then you push it. The ball rolls and gains kinetic energy. It had
            gone through an energy change. This energy change is called the work
            done. The work done is the change in an energy and it has another
            equation which is written below
            𝒘 = 𝒇 ∗ d</p> 
        <p>➢ This equation states that the work done is equal to the force applied to
            roll the ball multiplied by the distance that the ball had moved in
            direction of the force.</p>
            <p>➢ If we divide the work done by the time taken, we will get the power.
                𝒑𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓 =
                𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌/
                𝒕𝒊𝒎e </p>
            <p>➢ The unit of power is J/s or watt.</p> 
            <p>➢ Another alternative way to get the efficiency of a system is to divide the
                useful power output by the total power input.</p>
            <p>➢ Energy in forms such as electricity or heat or light that can be found in
                our homes, offices and schools can be obtained from:
                </p>
            <p>➢ In any system or process, part of the energy would be wasted or lost to
                the surroundings. We would say the energy is dissipated.
            (• Chemical energy stored in the fuel (e.g. coal) )
                </p> 
                <ol>1) When fuel is burnt, the chemical energy in the fuel is
                    turned to thermal energy.</ol>

      <ol>2) The thermal energy is used to heat a reservoir of water</ol>

      <ol>3) When the water heats, it evaporates producing steam. </ol>

      <ol>4) The steam produced rotates turbines. Thermal energy is
        now converted to kinetic energy</ol>

      <ol>5) Turbines rotate and drive generators producing electricity
        which movies in wires to our homes and offices. The kinetic
        energy is now converted to electric energy</ol>

      <ol>❖ Using fuels has the disadvantages of being non-renewable
        and finite. They also cause pollution by producing
        greenhouse gases when burnt.</ol>

      <ol> ❖ The advantages are being cheap and reliable and also
        contain a lot of energy.</ol>
        <p>• Wind power
            </p> 
      <ol>1) Wind turns wind mills rotating them.</ol>

      <ol>2) The wind mills rotate turbines. </ol>

      <ol>3) Turbines drive electric generators producing electricity</ol>
      <ol>4) The kinetic energy is converted to electric energy</ol>

      <ol>❖ Using wind has the disadvantages of being unreliable (you
        can’t rely on wind) and the windmills are noisy and the
        rotating blades of the mills kill birds </ol>

      <ol>❖ Using wind has the advantages of being infinite, renewable,
        environmentally friendly and cheap</ol>

            <p>• Water behind a dam (Hydroelectricity) </p>
            <ol>1) Water is collected in a lake when it rains</ol>

      <ol>2) It is collected uphill behind a dam. So, they have
        gravitational potential energy since they are elevated </ol>

      <ol>3) When electricity is needed, the dam opens and water flows
        in tubes down the hill. Gravitational potential energy is
        now converted to kinetic energy.</ol>
      <ol>4) When water moves it rotates turbines that drive generators
        producing electricity. Kinetic energy is now converted to
        electric energy.
        </ol>

      <ol>❖ The disadvantages of this method are that it is
        unreliable (you can’t rely entirely on rains and hills)
        and that the lake should be uphill.</ol>

      <ol>❖ The advantages are being cheap and environmentally
        friendly and renewable as well.</ol>
            <p>• Water wave and tidal power
               </p> <p>When waves of water move back and forth, they would move a
                floating buoyancy. This kinetic energy will then be converted to
                electric.
                </p>
                <ol>❖ The disadvantages of this method are that it is
                    unreliable (you can’t rely entirely on how strong the
                    waves are) </ol>
            
                  <ol>❖ The advantages are being cheap and environmentally
                    friendly and renewable as well.</ol>
            <p>• Solar cells</p><p>
                When light from the sun falls on photoelectric cells called solar
                cells, the light energy is directly converted to electricity.</p> 
                <ol>❖ The disadvantages of this method are that it is unreliable and
                    manufacturing solar cells are expensive and causes pollution  </ol>
            
                  <ol>❖ The advantages are being environmentally friendly when running
                    it not when manufacturing and renewable as wel</ol>
            <p>• Solar panels</p><p>
                Solar panels are pipes containing water that get heated by the
                sun. </p>
                <p>• Geothermal energy </p> <ol>1) Water is pumped in tubes underground.</ol>

                <ol>2) The heat from the core of the earth would cause the water
                    to become steam</ol>
          
                <ol>3) Steam rotates turbines</ol>
                <ol>4) Turbines drive generators
                  </ol>
          
                <ol>5) Thermal energy to kinetic energy to electric energy</ol>
          
                <ol>❖ The disadvantages of this method is it will take a lot
                    of money and time to set it up.</ol>
                    <ol>❖ The advantages are being environmentally friendly,
                        renewable and reliable</ol>
                        <p>
                            • Nuclear fission (will be discussed in detail in section 5 of atomic
                            physics)  </p>
                    <p>Neutrons are bombarded onto a nuclei splitting it into two more
                        nuclei releasing more neutrons which split other nuclei and the
                        chain reaction goes on.</p>  <ol>❖ The main disadvantages of this method is that it’s very
                            hazardous and expensive
                            </ol>
                            <ol>❖ The main advantage is it produces a large amount of
                                electricity.
                                </ol><p>
                                    ➢ Notice that the above methods (except tidal, Geothermal, nuclear) have
                                    the same source which is the Sun
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                        ➢ And the main source of energy in the sun is nuclear fusion (not fission)
                                        which is basically fusing or joining two nuclei together. 
                                         </p>
